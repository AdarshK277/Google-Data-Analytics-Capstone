### Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Data Collection
You will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. 
For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions.
